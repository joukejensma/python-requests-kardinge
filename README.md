Using POST requests this tool performs automatic bookings at the speed skating rink.
Preferred dates and times to book are taken from an ini file.
When a booking is performed the booking is disabled in the ini file itself.
The program periodically checks for availability.

As of now the program does not work as the ice rink has closed down for the winter 2021 season.
